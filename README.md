# train-scheduler
A simple to use mock train scheduler. 

### How To Use

A table displays all relevant information for train schedules, including the name of the train, its destination, the frequency of arrival, the next scheduled arrival time, and time until departure.

A form takes input to enter a new train into the database. All that is needed is the train name, destination, initial train arrival time, and frequency. The application will calculate the next arrival time and the time until departure. 

### Form Validation

A simple form validation was implemented to ensure the app will run correctly and prevent bad data getting pushed to the server.
